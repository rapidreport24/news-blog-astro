The subseafloor biosphere, one of the Earth’s largest and most stable microbial habitats, mainly consists of energy-limited sediments where microbial life persists over geological timescales. However, the mechanisms governing microbial community assembly and evolution under condition of extreme energy limitation remains unclear. Here, we analysed a 296 m sediment core off the Shimokita Peninsula using [...]The post Evolutionary Stasis And Homogeneous Selection Structure Microbial Communities In The Deep Subseafloor Sedimentary Biosphere appeared first on Astrobiology.
