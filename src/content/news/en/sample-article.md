# Sample News Article

This is a sample article created to test the Astro blog setup.

Once your Firebase Functions start running, real articles will be automatically generated and pushed here every 2 hours.

## What happens next?

1. Firebase Functions fetch news from APIs
2. Gemini AI rewrites the articles
3. Articles are pushed to GitHub
4. Netlify auto-rebuilds this site
5. Your Flutter app fetches summaries from Firestore
