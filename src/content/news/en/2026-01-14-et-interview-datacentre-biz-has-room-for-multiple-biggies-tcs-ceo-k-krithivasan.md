Tata Consultancy Services is in talks with multiple AI firms to set up data centres in India and is pursuing acquisitions to build AI capabilities. CEO K Krithivasan said AI-driven projects are growing despite some short-term revenue cannibalisation, while CFO Samir Seksaria confirmed net headcount fell 11,151 in Q3, with hiring continuing.
